    <h4>TESTIMONIALS</h4>
      <p>1973<br>Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting A<br>Apart from the three big hits at the beginning of the album, this was something of a hit, too. And you can immediately tell why. It is a rollicking, and one of his most infectious and danceable songs! Elton John gives one of his more spirited vocal performances.</p>
      <p>1978<br>Reverie C<br>Ew. No! I don't know what he was doing here. It's a one-minute instrumental consisting of random piano chords while a high-pitched synthesizer whistles over it. Dumb. Boring.</p>
      <p>1980<br>Sartorial Eloquence C<br>A sweeping ballad this time, but the melody just isn't up to the snuff. Technically, (instrumentation-wise) it's just like the previous track, but the hooks are lesser. Of course, they're still there, but ... John is so dependent on them!</p>
      <p>1981<br>Elton's Song A<br>And then there's "Elton's Song" ... a little ditty he dedicates to himself?? Whatever the case, this one's not actually so bad. It's a ballad, but the melody is rather catchy and even a bit haunting. The instrumentation consists of merely Elton playing a piano and singing (with a little bit of tasteful synths after awhile) which I guess is all he ever needed.</p>
      <p>1987<br>The Greatest Discovery B<br>There is a pretty dramatic use of the full orchestra at the beginning and end of this, but the rest of it most prominently features Elton singing with his piano. Yeah, this is a lovely song, as most things from that album were, but this is on the boring side of things. Seriously, stop playing stuff from Elton John if it's not going to be “Your Song!”</p>
      <p>1987<br>Your Song A<br>Hey, finally! He performed half of the songs from Elton John before he finally got to this one, but was it worth the wait? Sure it was. I always welcome hearing this good classic! A flute-dominated orchestra comes in and makes it even fruitier than it originally was. Hey, I'm not saying that's a bad thing.</p>
